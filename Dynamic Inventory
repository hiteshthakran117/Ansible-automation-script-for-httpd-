In this concept the dynamic inventory let's understand by the help of a example in the AWS .
Let's lounch three instance in the AWS one is controle node and second and third are  the targate node . 

In this concept the dynamic inventory need the key is create at the time of the instance lounch .

the command for this key transfer from the window operating system to the ec2 linux operating system two way by GUI or CLI . 

befor it all copy the     kegggg.pem        this file in the         Myfile.txt this file 

the command for the cli is :-

scp -i "C:\Users\Hitesh\Downloads\kegggg.pem" "C:\Users\Hitesh\Desktop\Myfile.txt" ec2-user@52.23.160.69:/home/ec2-user/file
heare the scp is thr protoclall name secquare copy protocall having port no is 22 like ssh it is basically the ssh service part  then the "C:\Users\Hitesh\Downloads\kegggg.pem"
this is the  location of the file in the window operating system and  this is the actual file whic go in the ec2 user instance "C:\Users\Hitesh\Desktop\Myfile.txt"
then after all is the user name or the ip and the path where the file is store in the instance 

then after the file copy ot transfer sucessfully then change the mode of the file is a txt file and conver to the .pem  file for th key authontaction 

the command for this :-
 chmod 400 file location   

than after this u will able to do ssh to the TN by using the key file in this case is name kegggg.pem

let's perform the dynamic inventory :-

create a .yaml file for the dynamic inventry by using a command # vi inventory.yaml

in the file add in the json formate a script it fatch the server ip and other thing's based on requirnment 

plugin: amazon.aws.aws_ec2
regions:
  - us-east-1
filters:
  instance-state-name: running
hostnames:
  - dns-name
compose:
  ansible_host: public-ip-address
keyed_groups:
  - key: tags.Name
    prefix: tag
strict: false        # to disable host key checking if you want (optional)
ansible_user: ec2-user
ansible_ssh_private_key_file: /root/kegggg.pem


then after the file create install the ansible by using the command 
# yum install -y ansible-core  
also install the python3 pip command for install the software or the package's /
# yum install -y python3 pip 

then install the python lybrarie's 
# pip install boto3 botocore 

then configer the aws cil first download it and then fill the cradianceal's your acces key  security key and all 

 yum install awscli -y
aws configure
 aws s3 ls  // this command show any kind of arrer that mean's somthing wrong . 

then after the command is to very file eveything is working properlly or not the dynamic inventory specially :-

#ansible-inventory -i inventory.yaml --list  // if this show any kind of error it mean's not working it it show the instance all about he server running 
in the perticular region menan's good 

it it show the error need to update the ansible-core 
# pip install --upgrade ansible-core
ansible --version
ansible-inventory -i /root/aws_ec2.yaml --list  

it is not working that mean's the module or the package not avilable /////////////amazon.aws
ansible-galaxy collection install amazon.aws


after it check working or not 

ping to all the instance in the server .
ansible -i inventory.yaml all -m ping --private-key mykey.pem -u ec2-user

also use this  
ansible-inventory -i inventory.yaml --list
this ping easly 


then create a play book :- 
vi install_httpd.yaml


and run it :-------
ansible-playbook -i aws_ec2.yaml install_httpd.yaml -u ec2-user --private-key=/root/kegggg.pem

for the verbose mode :-

ansible-playbook -i aws_ec2.yaml install_httpd.yaml -u ec2-user --private-key=/root/kegggg.pem -v

optional

ssh -i /root/kegggg.pem ec2-user@44.206.241.240


in the play book :-
---
- name: Install httpd on all EC2 instances from dynamic inventory
  hosts: all
  become: yes
  tasks:
    - name: Install httpd package
      package:
        name: vim
        state: present
