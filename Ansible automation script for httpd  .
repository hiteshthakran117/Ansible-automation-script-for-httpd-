Let's create an Ansible automation script for httpd web server .

step's for configer the apache web server 

1   install the package from internet or by using the yum command .

#yum install -y httpd 

2  create a web server file in the directory /var/www/httpd  with the extenctionof file (.html ) .

# cd /var/www/httpd 
# vim index.html  

3  After the file created start the service httpd on your operating system /server 

#systemctl start httpd 
Also enable the service httpd for every booting time of OS the service is auto matically start 
#systemctl enable httpd 

The Automation script for the whole work is :-  
there ate two ways to write the command the automation script in the ansible by the help of the playbook  or the cli ansible command's

Ansible command line script:- 

#ansible all -m package -a "name=httpd  state=present"   // this install the package httpd in all the Targated node that peresent in the Host file of the Ansible  /etc/ansible/host .

#ansible all -m copy -a "src=vimal.html dest=/var/www/html"  // this will copy the  file index.html from the Controle node to the Targaterd node . 
if  you want to create the file in the same instance of the Targated node's .

#ansible all -m ansible.builtin.file -a "path=/var/www/html/index.html state=touch"     or   #ansible all -m file -a"path=/var/www/html/index.html state=touch"

# ansible all -m  service -a "name=httpd state=started"

the playbook for this perticular Task :-

- hosts: all
  become: yes
  tasks:
    - name: install the httpd package
      package:
        name: httpd
        state: present

    - name: create index.html file (empty)
      file:
        path: /var/www/html/index.html
        state: touch

    - name: write content to index.html
      copy:
        dest: /var/www/html/index.html
        content: "hi this is hitesh\n"

    - name: start the httpd service
      service:
        name: httpd
        state: started
        enabled: yes


in this playbook  the  file index.html is create in the TN not copy from the  CN .
